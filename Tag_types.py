Your task is to explore the data a bit more.
Before you process the data and add it into MongoDB, you should check the "k"
value for each "<tag>" and see if they can be valid keys in MongoDB, as well as
see if there are any other potential problems.

We have provided you with 3 regular expressions to check for certain patterns
in the tags. As we saw in the quiz earlier, we would like to change the data
model and expand the "addr:street" type of keys to a dictionary like this:
{"address": {"street": "Some value"}}
So, we have to see if we have such tags, and if we have any tags with
problematic characters.
